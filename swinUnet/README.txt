I found online on Medium, the implementation of a U-Net style architecture that uses Swin Transformer as a back bone. I will try to recreate 
it in order to get to know it better. At the end I will try to create the equivalent using Video Swin transformer as a backbone.

At first I want to execute the Swin Unet with dummy inputs to see how the shape of the data changes as it goes through the model.
